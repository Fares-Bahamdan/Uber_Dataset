# Uber_Dataset

This is Our Project submission for ICS 474

Uber: Uber is a multinational transportation network company that operates through a mobile app, connecting passengers with drivers for on-demand rides. With a vast network of drivers and a user-friendly interface, Uber offers a convenient and reliable transportation service worldwide.

Notebook Work: In this notebook, we have analyzed a dataset containing information about Uber rides. The dataset includes details such as start and end dates, category, start and stop locations, miles traveled, and purpose of the ride. We have performed various tasks such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and modeling using machine learning algorithms. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we have gained insights into the patterns and trends present in the data.
